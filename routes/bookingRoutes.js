// This code defines the booking routes for handling GET and POST requests related to bookings.
// It uses Express.js to create a router, defines the routes, and interacts with the Booking model to fetch and save booking data.
// The GET route retrieves all bookings from the database, while the POST route creates a new booking based on the request body.
// The code also includes error handling to return appropriate status codes and messages in case of errors during database operations.
// The router is then exported for use in the main application file, allowing it to be mounted on a specific path (e.g., '/bookings') in the server setup.
// This code is part of a Node.js application that uses Express.js and Mongoose to manage bookings for an embassy.
// It is designed to handle HTTP requests related to booking appointments, including retrieving existing bookings and creating new ones.
// The code is structured to follow best practices, including using async/await for asynchronous operations and proper error handling.
// The router is intended to be used in conjunction with an Express.js application, where it can be mounted on a specific path (e.g., '/bookings') to handle booking-related requests.
